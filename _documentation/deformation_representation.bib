  abstract = {Electron back scatter diffraction ~EBSD! mapping and indexing has rapidly come into widespread use. However, inadequate attention has been paid to the details of the method. Many of the algorithms in current use were chosen because they were the first ones that were found to work, rather than because they were optimum. Results of systematic study are presented. It is shown that more than one method can successfully correct a sampling artifact, that there is an optimum binning ratio, that Gaussian filtering provides an alternative to ?butterfly convolution,? that better alternatives for mapping image quality than those in current use are available, and that saving all the original patterns is practical and advantageous.}

     pages = {3047-3055},
  abstract = {The diffuseness of electron back scatter patterns (EBSPs) is observed to increase with plastic strain. The application of this technique to deformation studies has been limited by the lack of a general method of measuring the pattern quality. The degradation of EBSPs by cold work was thus thoroughly investigated using the AI 6061 alloy for the purpose. Methods for enhancing the Kikuchi band contrast by removal of the background intensity variation from digital images of (112) zone axes present in the EBSP have been developed. The constrast of the Kikuchi bands was quantified using the root mean square intensity of averaged band profiles, while the sharpness of the patterns was assessed by the attenuation of high frequency components of Fourier transforms of the enhanced images and of the averaged band profiles. Tilt was found to effect contrast but not sharpness, while cold work reduced both. However, surface contamination produced effects that were very similar to those of specimen deformation. A method is presented for quantitative determination of EBSP quality, which is independent of grain orientation and is based on the first moment of power spectra (the square of the Fourier transform) of features common to all patterns to be compared.}

  abstract = {Image quality ~IQ! maps constructed from electron backscatter diffraction data provide useful visualizations of microstructure. The contrast in these maps arises from a variety of sources, including phase, strain, topography, and grain boundaries. IQ maps constructed using various IQ metrics are compared to identify the most prominent contrast mechanism for each metric. The conventional IQ metric was found to provide the superior grain boundary and strain contrast, whereas an IQ metric based on the average overall intensity of the diffraction patterns was found to provide better topological and phase contrast.}

  abstract = {Polycrystalline aggregates are comprised of three microstructural features: grain centers, grain boundaries, and regions affected by grain boundaries. It is these features that determine the mechanical properties, and any advanced understanding of microstructure-property relations requires their quantitative description. Traditionally, descriptions of microstructures have been based on visualization, i.e., how grains appear in the optical or scanning electron microscope (SEM). While this may lead to classification systems that permit differentiation, it does not allow for quantification, especially in complex microstructures, and does not lend itself to either developing or applying structure-property relationships. The goal of this paper is to present a new approach to the characterization of complex microstructures, especially those found in advanced modern high strength steels. For such steels, the new approach employs the fact that different types of ferrite formed at different transformation temperatures have different dislocation or sub-grain boundary densities. Hence, measuring the degree of lattice imperfection of the grain centers of the ferrite is one way of first identifying, then grouping, and finally quantifying, the different types or forms of ferrite. The index chosen in this study to distinguish the degree of lattice imperfection is the image quality (IQ). Finally, as part of the new approach a procedure has been developed to improve the accuracy of applying IQ measurements.}
